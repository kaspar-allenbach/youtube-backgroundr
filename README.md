Youtube Videos as Background thingys

This small script loads a youtube video via the youtube API into a div.

- The video is behind the fallback image until the video is loaded
- On small devices only the fallback image is loaded saving bandwidth
- No jQuery needed
- The transition from the fall back to the video is not the best yet because it is not pixel perfect. But I guess thats pretty much impossible.
